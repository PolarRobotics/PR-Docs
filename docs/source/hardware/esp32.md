### CPU and Internal Memory
- The ESP32-S0WD contains one low-power Xtensa® 32-bit LX6 microprocessor. The internal memory includes:
  - 448 KB of ROM for booting and core functions.
  - 520 KB of on-chip SRAM for data and instructions.
  - 8 KB of SRAM in RTC, which is called RTC FAST Memory and can be used for data storage; it is accessed by the main CPU during RTC Boot from the deep-sleep mode.
  - 8 KB of SRAM in RTC, which is called RTC SLOW Memory and can be accessed by the co-processor during the Deep-sleep mode.
  - 1 Kib of eFuse, of which:
    - 256 bits are used for the system (MAC address and chip configuration) 
    - 768 bits are reserved for customer applications, including flash-encryption and chip-ID.
