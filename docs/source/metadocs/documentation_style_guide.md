# Documentation Style Guide
- This document contains rules that are to be followed when creating or updating this documentation repository.

## File Locations
- All documentation files (generall Markdown) must be located within `/docs/source/` or a subfolder.
	- Most documentation category folders are located exactly at this level of the file structure.

## Naming Conventions
- Do not use capital lettering for any folder or file name without explicit approval from the project manager.
- Documentation category folder names (i.e., folders under `/docs/source/`) shall use lower kebab case (ex. `data-aq`).
- File names shall use lower snake case (ex. `documentation_style_guide.md`).
