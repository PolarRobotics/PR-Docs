# Setting up your Development Environment
## Overview
- In this tutorial, you will install Visual Studio Code with the PlatformIO extension and other extensions necessary to work with the Polar Robotics codebase.

### Prerequisites
- Access to a computer (preferably a laptop) with an internet connection
	- Note: this tutorial is primarily aimed at Windows 10/11. If you own a Mac or Linux computer, you may have to make changes and are expected to have some idea of how to work on your own.
- Completion of the [Git Training](./git), and by extension:
	- A completed installation of Git
	- A GitHub account

## Cloning the Polar Robotics repository
### Command-Line
- If you are comfortable with the Git command-line interface, you can simply run the command below from your desired parent directory.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/PolarRobotics/ESP32PRCodebase
```

### Graphical
1. Copy the link below. Tip: hovering over the top right of the codeblock will reveal a button you can click to copy the contents of the codeblock to your clipboard.
```
https://github.com/PolarRobotics/ESP32PRCodebase
```
2. Open GitHub Desktop. 
3. Click `File -> Clone repository...` <br> ![Step 3](../_static/images/training/devenv/devenv-clone-1.png){w=250px}
4. Switch to the `URL` tab on the right. <br>![Step 4|350](../_static/images/training/devenv/devenv-clone-2.png){w=300px}
5. In the first box (hint text `URL or username/repository`), paste the URL you copied earlier. <br> ![Step 5|400](../_static/images/training/devenv/devenv-clone-3.png){w=400px}
	- Alternatively, you can simply type `PolarRobotics/ESP32PRCodebase`.
6. Change the directory (`Local path`) to something other than `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\GitHub`. 
	- It is recommended to create a folder on your desktop or somewhere else memorable to house all your code projects. Better yet, create a subfolder there specifically for Polar Robotics, as you will eventually use more than one repo.
7. Click `Clone`, and wait for Git to clone the repository from GitHub.

## Installing Visual Studio Code
1. Download and run the VSCode installer from [https://code.visualstudio.com/Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) <br> ![Step 1|550](../_static/images/training/devenv/devenv-vscode-1.png)
