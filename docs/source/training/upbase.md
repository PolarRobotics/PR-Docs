# Upbase
## Our Project Management Tool
### Overview
- [Upbase](https://upbase.io/) is a project management tool used to create, assign, monitor, and log tasks for each subteam.
	- All teams—not only team leads but also regular members—are expected to use Upbase to track their tasks.

```{admonition} Why Upbase?
:class: note

- We began using Upbase beginning in Fall 2024, replacing Trello and later ClickUp, due to the pricing model change and feature excess, respectively.
- Upbase is free for teams of unlimited size (unlike Trello, which is limited to 10) and has a clean user interface with a suitable but not overwhelming set of features.
```

```

### Glossary and Structure
- Before discussing usage, it is important to understand what the different parts of Upbase's user interface are called.

- Upon joining a team, you will be invited to the Polar Robotics *workspace*, which is "a top-level organizational unit" containing all relevant tasks for all teams.
- Each team (Design, Manufacturing, Build, Programming, and Drive) has their own **list**. The equivalent in Trello is a *board*. Lists are accessible via the navigation sidebar on the left. ![Navigation](../_static/images/training/upbase/upbase_structure_1_navbar.png)
- There are two main modes for viewing a list: *list view* and *board view*. By default, when viewing a list, it may be in *list view*. 
- You may use either, but if you are used to Trello, you will likely prefer *board view*, and are used to referring to a *list* as a *board*.
	- List view looks like this: ![List View|600](../_static/images/training/upbase/upbase_structure_2_list_view.png)
	- Board view looks like this: ![Board View|600](../_static/images/training/upbase/upbase_structure_3_board_view.png)
	- You can change between list and board view by clicking the `View` menu in the top right of the UI and selecting the appropriate button, as shown in the two images above. ![Change View|600](../_static/images/training/upbase/upbase_structure_4_change_view.png)
- Lists contain **sections**, which are visible in the pictures above – in this case, they are named `Future`, `Active`, and `Completed`.
	- In board view, *list sections* are the Upbase equivalent to Trello's *lists*.
- List sections contain **tasks**, which are the core items used in Upbase. A *task* is a collection of information about a particular project or subproject, including assignees, due date, priority, tags, description, and links to relevant resources.
	- Tasks may also be colloquially referred to as *cards*.
	- Tasks may have *subtasks*, which have all the same properties as normal tasks, but they are not viewed as a normal "card" within the list of origin, except in certain special circumstances (explained later).
- **Tags** are workspace-level entities that may be attached to individual tasks to denote grouping. 
	- Currently, we use tags for three purposes: 1. grouping tasks related to a specific robot or robot version, 2. grouping tasks related to a specific project, and 3. other miscellaneous administrative categories.
	- Usage details may be found in the [Tags](./upbase#tags) section below.
- Within Polar Robotics, *lists* themselves may be referred to as "boards" and list sections may colloquially be referred to as simply "lists" or "task lists" – this is fine so long as everyone can understand what is meant.
	- For instance, "the Build board" refers to the Upbase list named "Build" assigned to the build team. Meanwhile, "the todo list" would refer to a list section named "Todo" in a specific list, say, `Programming` (implied by context).
